# 0x0F. C - Function Pointers

## Description
This project focuses on the concept of function pointers in C. It covers various tasks aiming to understand and apply function pointers in different scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
- What function pointers are and how to use them
- The function pointer's composition and its role in virtual memory
- Implementation and utilization of function pointers in C

## Tasks Overview
The project is divided into several tasks. Below is a brief overview:

### Task 0: What's my name
Write a function to print a name based on specified criteria.

### Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Create a function to execute a given function on each element of an array.

### Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Design a function to search for a specific integer in an array.

### Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Develop a program to perform simple mathematical operations.
